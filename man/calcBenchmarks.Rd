\description{
This internal function calculates a variety of benchmarks for simulated data at the peptide, protein, and PTM levels. These benchmarks include metrics such as the number of peptides and proteins, dynamic range, true positive rates, false discovery rates, and differences between ground truth and measured fold changes. The results are organized into a comprehensive list, which can be used to evaluate the performance of different simulation scenarios.
