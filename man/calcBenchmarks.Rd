\description{
This internal function calculates a variety of benchmarks for simulated data at the
peptidoform, protein-group, and proteoform levels. Peptidoform-level metrics are
computed from the full peptide table (modified + unmodified), while protein-level
metrics refer to protein groups after inference/summarisation.
These benchmarks include metrics such as the number of peptidoforms and protein groups,
dynamic range, true positive rates, false discovery rates, and differences between ground
truth and measured fold changes. The results are organized into a comprehensive list,
which can be used to evaluate the performance of different simulation scenarios.
