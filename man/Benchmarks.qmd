This document provides a detailed description of the benchmarks used in the ProteoMaker pipeline. ProteoMaker is a tool for generating an in-silico bottom-up LC-MS dataset from proteoforms. The pipeline simulates various stages of the experimental process, from the generation of ground truth data to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and statistical testing. These benchmarks are essential for comparing the results and evaluating the performance of the pipeline. For more information about the project, visit [ProteoMaker on GitHub](https://github.com/computproteomics/ProteoMaker).

## List of Benchmarks

The following values and distributions are collected and will be used for comparing the results.

### Peptide Level

-   **Total Number of Peptides**: Counts both modified and non-modified peptides. Fixed PTMs are not considered "modified".
-   **Number of Proteins**: Total number of all proteins, independently whether shared or uniquely identified.
-   **Proportion of Unique Modified and Non-Modified Peptides**: Measures the proportion of peptides that are unique and either modified or non-modified.
-   **Total Number of Unique Stripped Sequences**: Counts the unique sequences after removing modifications.
-   **Percentage Missingness**: Calculates the percentage of missing values in the data.
-   **AUC of ROC Curve for Correct Differentially Regulated Features**: Area under the ROC curve for correctly identifying differentially regulated peptides.
-   **TPR (True Positive Rate)**: Found proportion of correct differentially regulated peptides, with FDR \< 0.05/0.01.
-   **True FDR for Estimated FDR**: True false discovery rate for an estimated FDR of 0.01/0.05.
-   **Proportion of Cleaved Peptides**: Proportion of peptides per number of miscleavages.
-   **Retention Time Range**: The range of retention times (max-min).
-   **Dynamic Range**: The dynamic range of peptide intensities on a log2 scale (max-min).
-   **Number of Accepted PSMs**: Count of accepted peptide-spectrum matches, based on scan numbers.
-   **Sum of Squares Residuals Towards Actual Fold-Changes**: Assigns mean fold-change for peptides with multiple assigned fold-changes, only calculated for the first 2 conditions.
-   **Mean of Std. Dev. Within Replicates**: The mean standard deviation within replicates of peptides with actual fold-changes, on a log scale.
-   **Distribution of Quantitative Values (Skewness)**: Measures how asymmetric the distribution of quantitative values is.
-   **Distribution of Quantitative Values (Kurtosis)**: Measures how normal (peaked) the distribution of quantitative values is.

-   **Distribution of Quantitative Values (Skewness)**: Measures how asymmetric the distribution of quantitative values is at the protein level.
-   **Distribution of Quantitative Values (Kurtosis)**: Measures how normal (peaked) the distribution of quantitative values is at the protein level.
-   **Distribution of Quantitative Values (Standard Deviation)**: Measures how broad the distribution of quantitative values is at the protein level.

### PTM Level

-   **Total Number and Mean of Quantitatively Represented Proteoforms per Protein**: Includes protein groups, can only be calculated for in silico data.
-   **Number of Modified Peptides**: Total number of modified peptides.
-   **Proportion of Modified Peptides with Identical Non-Modified Form**: Measures the proportion of modified peptides that have an identical non-modified form.
-   **AUC of ROC Curve for Correct Differentially Regulated Modified Peptides**: After adjusting for protein amount, the area under the ROC curve for correctly identifying differentially regulated modified peptides.
