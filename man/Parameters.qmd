# PhosFake Pipeline Parameters

This document provides a detailed description of the parameters used in the PhosFake pipeline. PhosFake is a tool for generating an in-silico bottom-up LC-MS dataset from proteoforms. The pipeline simulates various stages of the experimental process, from the generation of ground truth data to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and statistical testing.

## Experimental Design

### Number of Conditions

*Param\$NumCond*: The number of different experimental conditions to be tested. For example, if you are comparing treated versus untreated samples, this value would be 2. This parameter is crucial for setting up the experimental design. Default set to `2`.

### Number of Replicates

*Param\$NumReps*: The number of biological or technical replicates for each condition. Replicates are essential for statistical validity and reproducibility of the results. Ensuring adequate replication helps in reducing variability and increasing the reliability of the results. Default set to `5`.

## Input Data Paths

### Path to FASTA File

*Param\$PathToFasta*: The file path to the FASTA file containing the protein sequences. This file is essential for identifying and quantifying proteins in your samples. Accurate protein identification depends heavily on the quality and completeness of the FASTA file. Default set to `InputData/fasta_full_human.fasta`.

### Path to Protein List

*Param\$PathToProteinList*: The file path to a list of proteins of interest, if any. This can be used to focus the analysis on a subset of proteins.
